# Customer-Purchasing-Behaviour
There are some new products on the market that you are interested in selling. But you want to target a specific type of clients for each one of the products and how we gonna achieve it.
Machine learning comes in handy for this task.
Particularly, clustering, the most important unsupervised learning problem, is able to create categories grouping similar individuals. 
These categories are called clusters. A cluster is a collection of points in a dataset. 
These points are more similar between them than they are to points belonging to other clusters.
Distance-based clustering groups the points into some number of clusters such that distances within the cluster should be small while distances between clusters should be large.
For this particular project, we'll work with two scikit-learn modules: Kmeans and PCA. They will allow us to perform a clustering algorithm and dimensionality reduction.
